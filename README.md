## 🩺 Chronic Disease Analysis with Python

This project focuses on the **exploratory data analysis and visualization** of chronic disease data. Using Python's powerful data science libraries, the goal is to identify trends, correlations, and critical health indicators that contribute to chronic diseases—empowering healthcare decision-making and early intervention.

### 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess chronic disease data for analysis.
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand distribution and patterns.
- Create **interactive visualizations** to highlight relationships between variables.
- Generate a **correlation heatmap** to find impactful health indicators.
- Provide insights that can guide **preventive strategies and awareness**.

### 🧰 Technologies & Libraries

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations
- **Plotly** – for interactive visualizations and 3D charts
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – for visual analysis (if applicable)
- **Jupyter Notebook** – as the development environment

---

### 📊 Analysis Performed

- Summary statistics of health metrics like age, Blood Pressure and other health history.
- Identification of missing values and data cleaning.
- Correlation analysis to uncover relationships between variables.
- Visual analysis using interactive heatmaps to enhance understanding.

---

### 💡 Key Takeaways

- Identified strong correlations between factors like age, Blood Pressure, blood cell counts, etc. 
- Interactive visualizations helped simplify the understanding of multivariate relationships.
- The project sets a foundation for building a **predictive model** or risk scoring system.
